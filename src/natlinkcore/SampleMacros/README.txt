These are a mixture of sample macros.

The last one added is testDialogForDictationGrammar.py, which features catching some dictate, which was never working in my (Quintijn) memory. I insert this for completeness (August 24).

_samplehypothesis.py is an example of the hypothesis mode working, in answer to a question of in real time translators. Waiting for the full result of a dictated phrase would take too long for the (television watching) audience, so in that case the hypothesis mode can do its work.
